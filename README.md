# the-less-watcher
Just a small Python script that I use with Flask to autocompile less files into one styles.less file on change.

# Run
To run the script:
python watcher.py folder/with/less/files

The folder added as argument and its sub folders are scanned for less-files. Those are compiled into one styles.less file stored in the same folder.
